# FozzieJS

Type safe client for the WakaTime REST API forked from WakaTimeJS

## Motivation

WakaTimeJS didn't have many updates, and it used axios which has been prone to security vulnerabilities and my latest bun project has issues with it. This for uses fetch to hopefully avoid those issues.

## Installation

```bash
npm install fozziejs
```

or

```bash
yarn add fozziejs
```

## Usage

Coming Soon. WakaTimeJS readme included incorrect usage examples, so I'll rewrite this as I have time.
